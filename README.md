# Employee Income Prediction ML Application

This machine learning project is designed to predict whether an individual's income exceeds **$50K USD per year** based on demographic and work-related attributes. The model is trained on the widely used **UCI Adult Income Dataset** and provides predictions via an intuitive web interface using **Streamlit**.

---

## Project Overview

- **Problem Statement**: Predict the income of individuals (`<=50K` or `>50K`) from structured census and demographic data.
- **Dataset**: UCI Adult Income Census dataset (45K+ instances); includes features like age, education, occupation, capital gains/losses, hours worked per week, etc.
- **Target Variable**: `income` (binary: `<=50K`, `>50K`)


## Features

Train & Compare Multiple ML Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Linear Regression (for reference)
- Polynomial Regression

Key Functionality:
- Dynamic feature selection via checkboxes
- Model selection to compare performance and predictions
- Automated model evaluation and ranking
- Hyperparameter tuning for selected models (optional)
- Live prediction interface with real-time form inputs
- Optimized training and preprocessing pipeline using `scikit-learn` Pipelines

## Preprocessing Pipeline

The dataset goes through the following preprocessing stages:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Replaces "?" entries and drops rows with critical missing fields
2. **Label Encoding**: Categorical features are encoded consistently using `LabelEncoder`
3. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler`
4. **Train-Test Splitting**: 80/20 stratified split using `train_test_split`
5. **Model Pipelines**: Each model is integrated with preprocessing steps using `Pipeline` for reproducibility

## Model Performance Metrics

All models are evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **ROC-AUC**
- **Cross-Validation Score (Mean Â± Std Dev)**
- **Classification Report**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Best model (based on accuracy): **XGBoost**
- Test Accuracy: 86.16%
- ROC-AUC: 92.04%

## Streamlit Application

A beautiful interactive frontend using Streamlit takes user inputs and delivers real-time income predictions.

### Key UI Features:
- Model selection from dropdown
- Feature selection using checkboxes
- Displays accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix of selected model
- Upload test rows or manually query by filling form
- Visual themes and responsive design

To launch the app locally:

```
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```
